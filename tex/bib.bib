These tools are built on the Python requests package, which is used to make HTTP requests, and astropy, which provides most of the data parsing functionality. astroquery modules generally attempt to replicate the web page interface provided by a given service as closely as possible, making the transition from browser-based to command-line interaction easy. astroquery has received significant contributions from throughout the astronomical community, including several from telescope archives. astroquery enables the creation of fully reproducible workflows from data acquisition through publication. This paper describes the philosophy, basic structure, and development model of the astroquery package. The complete documentation for astroquery can be found atÂ http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/.}

            abstract = {We describe how to generate a longitudinal brightness map for a tidally locked exoplanet from its phase function light curve. We operate under a number of simplifying assumptions, neglecting limb darkening/brightening, star spots, detector ramps, as well as time variability over a single planetary rotation. We develop the transformation from a planetary brightness map to a phase function light curve and simplify the expression for the case of an edge-on system. We introduce two modelsâcomposed of longitudinal slices of uniform brightness, and sinusoidally varying mapsâwhich greatly simplify the transformation from map to light curve. We discuss numerical approaches to extracting a longitudinal map from a phase function light curve, explaining how to estimate the uncertainty in a computed map and how to choose an appropriate number of fit parameters. We demonstrate these techniques on a simulated map and discuss the uses and limitations of longitudinal maps. The sinusoidal model provides a better fit to the planetâs underlying brightness map, although the slice model is more appropriate for light curves which only span a fraction of the planetâs orbit. Regardless of which model is used, we find that there is a maximum of ~5 free parameters which can be meaningfully fit based on a full phase function light curve, due to the insensitivity of the latter to certain modes of the map. This is sufficient to determine the longitudes of primary equatorial hot spots and cold spots, as well as the presence of secondary maxima/minima.}

            abstract = {Resolving spatially varying exoplanet features from single-point light curves is essential for determining whether Earth-like worlds harbor geological features and/or climate systems that influence habitability. To evaluate the feasibility and requirements of this spatial-feature resolving problem, we present an analysis of multi-wavelength single-point light curves of Earth, where it plays the role of a proxy exoplanet. Here, â¼10,000 Deep Space Climate Observatory/Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera frames collected over a two-year period were integrated over the Earthâs disk to yield a spectrally dependent point source and analyzed using singular value decomposition. We found that, between the two dominant principal components (PCs), the second PC contains surface-related features of the planet, while the first PC mainly includes cloud information. We present the first two-dimensional (2D) surface map of Earth reconstructed from light curve observations without any assumptions of its spectral properties. This study serves as a baseline for reconstructing the surface features of Earth-like exoplanets in the future.}

            abstract = {Recent Spitzer infrared measurements of hot-Jupiter eclipses suggest that eclipse-mapping techniques could be used to spatially resolve the dayside photospheric emission of these planets using partial occultations. As a first step in this direction, we simulate ingress/egress light curves for three bright eclipsing hot Jupiters and evaluate the degree to which parameterized photospheric emission models can be distinguished from each other with repeated, noisy eclipse measurements. We find that the photometric accuracy of Spitzer is insufficient to use this tool effectively. On the other hand, the level of photospheric details that could be probed with a few JWST eclipse measurements could greatly inform hot-Jupiter atmospheric modeling efforts. A JWST program focused on nonparametric eclipse map inversions for hot Jupiters should be actively considered.}

            abstract = {We present a method that employs the secondary eclipse light curves of transiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their thermal emission. This technique permits an observer to resolve the surface of the planet without the need to spatially isolate its light from that of the central star. We evaluate the feasibility of this technique for the HD 209458 system by simulating observations made with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We consider two representations of the planetary thermal emission: a simple model parameterized by a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, and the results of a three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary atmosphere previously published by Cooper & Showman. We find that observations of the secondary eclipse light curve are most sensitive to a longitudinal asymmetry in the dayside planetary emission. To quantify this signal, we define a new parameter, the ``uniform time offset,'' which measures the time lag between the observed secondary eclipse and that predicted by a planet with spatially uniform emission. We compare the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD 20948 with the precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find that IRAC observations at 3.6Î¼m of a single secondary eclipse should permit sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper & Showman model of the surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands and find that a modest improvement in photometric precision should permit a similarly robust detection.}
